    answer: "Confirm that crawlers can request HTML, follow internal links, and store a coherent canonical URL before optimizing extras."

Technical SEO is the set of constraints that decide whether a page can rank at all. Content quality cannot compensate for a URL that is blocked, orphaned, or served as an unreadable rendering state.

## Why crawlability still comes first

Search engines discover URLs through sitemaps and links. If important templates are only reachable through JavaScript that never executes for the crawler, those templates stay invisible. Robots rules, parameter handling, and canonicals then determine which discovered URL is stored.

## Implementation notes

Keep a single preferred host, serve a complete HTML first response for primary templates, and make sure pagination, filters, and faceted navigation do not create infinite crawl spaces. Log crawler hits against the URLs you actually want indexed.

### Rendering and canonicals

Rendering should not invent a second copy of the same article at a parameter URL. Canonical tags, sitemaps, and internal links must agree.

## Where Things Stand
<!-- WHERE-THINGS-STAND:START -->
The conversation around crawlability has shifted toward rendering honesty and canonical agreement rather than more sitemap files.

## Key Takeaways

- Discovery, storage, and ranking are separate stages; most failures happen before ranking.
- Canonicals, sitemaps, and in-template links must describe the same URL.
- Fix crawl traps before commissioning more content on the same templates.
